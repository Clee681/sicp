* Compound procedures are used in exactly the same way as primitive procedures
* **Normal order evaluation**: fully expand and then reduce
* **Applicative order evaluation**: first evaluate the operand subexpressions and then apply the operands to the procedure
  * Lisp uses applicative order
* **Special forms** do not follow the general evaluation rule of combinations. That is, they do not follow the procedure of evaluating the subexpressions after which the operands (arguments) are passed to the procedure that is the value of the left-most operator
* Declarative vs. Imperative

> The contrast between function and procedure is a reflection of the general distinction between describing properties of things and describing how to do things, or, as it is sometimes referred to, the distinction between declarative knowledge and imperative knowledge. In mathematics, we are usually concerned with declarative knowledge (what is) descriptions whereas in computer science we are usually concerned with imperative (how to) descriptions.
